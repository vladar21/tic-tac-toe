### Clone a Repository Code Locally

To clone the repository and run this Tic Tac Toe game locally on your machine, you will need to follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python (at least version 3.6)
- A text editor or an IDE (like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)

#### Cloning the Repository

1. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal, command prompt, or Git bash in the directory where you wish to clone the repository.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following Git command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-with-ai.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with the actual username where the repository exists.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the cloned repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-with-ai
    ```

4. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

    For Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    For macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Install all the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the Python packages needed for the game to run.

6. **Run the Game**: You can now run the game using the following command:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

    Replace `main.py` with the actual entry script if itâ€™s named differently.
